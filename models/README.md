# Models Directory

This directory was previously used for storing local GGUF model files when using llama-cpp-python.

## Current Setup

The system now uses **Grok API** instead of local models. No model files need to be downloaded or stored locally.

## Old Configuration (Deprecated)

If you were using llama-cpp-python previously, that functionality has been removed. The system now exclusively uses Grok API via xAI.

## Need Help?

Refer to `SETUP_GUIDE.md` for current setup instructions.
